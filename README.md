# Pieck

A typeface based on the lettering of Anton Pieck for The Efteling has been floating around on the internet for years now. Alternative characters were mapped to random unrelated characters, and some of the glyphs had overlapping geometry.

This is an attempt to clean up this typeface, and eventually expand it. All aid is welcome.
